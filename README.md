# Plagiarism_Checker
A JAVA program which takes 2 text files as arguments and then uses Hash Tables, Queues and Linked Lists to verify if the files have been plagiarized or not. If the Hash table contains the key, then file has been plagiarized and the plagiarized content is shown on the screen. The 2 files passed as arguments are Corpus.txt and Target.txt. Corpus is used as the original file with contents and the Target file is used to see if it contains contents from the Corpus file.
